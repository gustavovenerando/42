## 42
42 is a tuition-free, peer-to-peer coding school designed to develop software engineers through a project-based, self-directed curriculum. Students learn by building projects and solving real-world problems, with no formal classes or teachers, emphasizing collaboration, problem-solving, and continuous learning.

## Goal
The goal of this repository is to collect the projects I’ve built during my time at 42, documenting my progress, challenges, and the lessons I’ve learned along the way. It serves both as a personal archive and a public showcase of my growth as I advance through the 42 curriculum.

## Disclaimer
Please don’t just copy and paste the code you find here. 42 is about learning through understanding and solving problems on your own, not using solutions you haven’t earned.
